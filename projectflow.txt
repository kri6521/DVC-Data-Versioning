1. create mycode.py and add code to it
2. pip install dvc
3. "dvc init"
4. "mkdir S3"
5. "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
6. "dvc add data/"   -> for any changes in data folder, dvc is responsible now
as git was tracking data before hand so we need to remove those by "git rm -r --cached 'data', then commit it then add the above command
The md5 inside data.dvc is the id we'll get evertime 
7. "dvc commit" and then "dvc push" -> here 2 files saved as 1 is csv and other is id
8. make changes to mycode.py to append new role in data, check changes via "dvc status"
